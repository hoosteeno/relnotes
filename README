The `make_new_release_json.py` script generates json representations of releases 
and outputs them into files in very specific directories. 

It takes a number of parameters, but requires none. In the absence of parameters 
it will generate files/dirs in ./output for Firefox and Firefox for mobile on 
Aurora/Beta/Release channels. 

It requires a `relnotes.sqlite` database file.

More docs to come.
